class FeatureMatcher:
    """
    Callable that matches the given dictionary against features.

    This creates a callable that can be used to easily check if features match the
    features and feature constraint defined by the matcher. When a matcher is created,
    the argument names are used as feature names and the argument values are either
    literal values to compare with or compiled regular expressions or callables.

    A FeatureMatcher matches as soon as all specified features match, no matter if the
    features we compare with contain additional features.

    In this example, the feature matcher will check if there are two features with the
    given names and values.

    Example:
        ```python
        fmatcher1 = FeatureMatcher(feature1 = "somevalue", feature2 = 999)
        if fmatcher(ann.features):
            print("Yay, both features are in ann.features!")
        ```

    In this example `feature1` matches if it matches the regular expression, and feature2
    matches if the given callable returns true.

    Example:
        ```python
        def checksize(x):
            return 12 <= x < 33
        NAMEPATTERN = re.compile(r"[A-Z][a-z_0-9]+")
        fmatcher2 = FeatureMatcher(name = NAMEPATTERN, size = checksize)
        ```
