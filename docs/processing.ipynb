    "* Corpus, DocumentSource, DocumentDestination: this is how collections of documents which can be read/written, \n",
    "  read only, or written only are represented in GateNLP. See [Corpora](corpora).\n",
    "* Annotator: an annotator is something that processes a document and returns the processed document. Most \n",
    "  annotators simple return the modified document but GateNLP abstractions also allow to return None to indicate\n",
    "  filtering a document or a list of documents (e.g. for splitting up documents)\n",
    "  Any Python callable can be used as an Annotator but GateNLP annotators in addition may implement the methods\n",
    "  `start` (to perform some start of corpus processing), `finish` (to perform some end of corpus processing and\n",
    "  return some over-the-corpus result) and `reduce` (to merge several partial over-the corpus results from parallel \n",
    "  processing into a single result). \n",
    "* Pipeline: a special annotator the encapsulates several annotators. When the pipeline is run on a document, \n",
    "  all the contained annotators are run in sequence. \n",

    "## Annotators\n",
    "\n",
    "Anny callable that takes a document and returns that document can act as an annotator. Note that an annotator\n",
    "usually modifies the annotations or features of the document it receives. This happens in place, so the annotator would not have to return the document. However, it is a convention that annotators always return the document that got modified to indicate this to downstream annotators or document destinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an annotator returns a list, the result of processing is instead the documents in the list which could be none, or more than one. This convention allows a processing pipeline to filter documents or generate several documents from a single one. \n",
