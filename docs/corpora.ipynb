    "\n",
    "Corpora are collections of documents and in GateNLP, there are three classes which represent collections of \n",
    "documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corpus: this is any object that behaves like a list or array of documents and allows to get and set the nth document via `mycorpus[n]` and `mycorpus[n] = doc`. A Python list can thus be used as a Corpus, but GateNLP provides other Corpus classes for getting and saving documents from/to a directory and other storage locations. \n",
    "* DocumentSource: this is something that can be used as an iterator over documents. Any iterable of documents can be used as DocumentSource, but GateNLP provides a number of classes to iterate over documents from other sources, like the result of a database query. \n",
    "* DocumentDestination: this is something where a document can be added to by invoking the `add` or `append` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Corpus and DocumentSource objects can be processed by an executor (see [Processing](processing))\n",
    "\n",
    "## JsonLinesFileSource and JsonLinesFileDestination\n",
    "\n",
    "This document source reads the JSON bdoc representation of a document from each line in an input file and \n",
    "produces the corresponding documents. When a gatenlp Document is saved as \"json\", i.e. in bdoc json format,\n",
    "all json is in a single line since any newline character gets escaped in the json representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it possible to store several documents in a single text file by having one json-serialization \n",
