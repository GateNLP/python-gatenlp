This is a test document.

It contains just a few sentences. 
Here is a sentence that mentions a few named entities like 
the persons Barack Obama or Ursula von der Leyen, locations
like New York City, Vienna or Beijing or companies like 
Google, UniCredit or Huawei. And here is Donald Trump, it may not be the real one :P

Lets say Boris Johnson aka Bojo tweets from his BorisJohnson account, would be nice to match them!

Here we include a URL https://gatenlp.github.io/python-gatenlp/ 
and a fake email address john.doe@hiscoolserver.com as well 
as #some #cool #hastags and a bunch of emojis like 😽 (a kissing cat),
👩‍🏫 (a woman teacher), 🧬 (DNA), 
🧗 (a person climbing), 

Here we test a few different scripts, e.g. Hangul 한글 or 
simplified Hanzi 汉字 or Farsi فارسی and Arabic ,اَلْعَرَبِيَّةُ, which goes from right to left.
